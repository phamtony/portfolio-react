## Porfolio built on create-react-app

This portfolio is powered by another personal project.

I created a simple and tailored headless CMS <a href="https://portfolio-api.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio-api</a>. It's purpose is to build your "resume" website. 

My porfolio uses the portfolio-api API to populate tonypham.dev
